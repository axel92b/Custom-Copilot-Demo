summary: "Resolve an endpoint for a given service called by Microsoft Fabric  \nResolves the endpoint for a given service called by Microsoft Fabric based on the tenant's region and workspace region. Fabric provides a set of context properties and returns the appropriate service endpoint URL and its time-to-live (TTL).\n\nThe Endpoint Resolution API is crucial for services that require dynamic endpoint determination based on operational context. This allows for optimized routing and regional compliance.\n\nTo resolve an endpoint, Fabric will send a POST request with the required context properties in the request body. The response will contain the resolved URL and its TTL, which indicates how long the URL is considered valid.\n\nFor a sample implementation and usage examples, please refer to the [Endpoint Resolution Sample Code](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Fabric-workload-development-sample/blob/main/Backend/src/Controllers/EndpointResolutionControllerImpl.cs)."
